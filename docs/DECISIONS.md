## Technology Stack

| Component | Choice | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 | App Router, React Server Components, optimal performance |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety, production reliability, better DX |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Custom design system support, utility-first approach |
| UI Library | Radix UI + Custom | High-quality primitives with neon gaming aesthetic |
| Animation | Framer Motion | Spring physics, gesture support, 60fps performance |
| State | Zustand | Lightweight, TypeScript-first, simple API |
| API | tRPC | End-to-end type safety, real-time subscriptions |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Robust, scalable, excellent JSON support |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe database access, great migrations |
| Deployment | Vercel | Optimal Next.js deployment, global CDN |

## Design System

**Neon-Dark Gaming Aesthetic:**
- Primary: Electric Green (#00ff88), Electric Blue (#00ccff)
- Background: Deep dark (#0a0a0f, #1a1a24, #2a2a3a)

- Animations: Spring physics with 0.3s standard duration
- Effects: Glow shadows, gradient borders, particle systems

## Quality Standards

| Metric | Target | Verification |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Lighthouse Score | >90 | Automated CI testing |
| Type Coverage | 100% | TypeScript strict mode |
| Test Coverage | >80% | Unit + integration + e2e |
| Accessibility | WCAG AA | Automated axe-core testing |
| Performance | <200ms API | Real user monitoring |
| Mobile Performance | >90 mobile score | Mobile Lighthouse testing |
