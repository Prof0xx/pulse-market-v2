## What to do

Read `docs/TASKS.md`. Find the first unchecked task. For EACH task:

1. Read the task's **Scope** and **Acceptance Criteria**.
2. Implement the minimum changes to satisfy the AC.
3. Run the task's **Verify** commands in the terminal.
4. If verify fails, fix the code and re-run until green.
5. Mark the task `[x]` in `docs/TASKS.md` and add a 1-2 line completion note.
6. **Move to the next unchecked task and repeat.**

Continue until all tasks are checked off or you hit a BLOCKED task.

## Innovation Brief

**PulseMarket** transforms prediction markets from traditional long-term betting platforms into a real-time gaming experience that feels like trading meets gaming meets social media. Users engage with rapid-fire 10-minute prediction cycles that create addictive engagement loops while leveraging Base blockchain for instant settlements.

**Differentiation Strategy:**
- **Lightning Rounds**: 10-minute prediction cycles with instant gratification vs months-long traditional markets
- **Social Pulse**: Community leaderboards, achievement systems, streak rewards 
- **Visual Trading**: Real-time candlestick-style odds visualization instead of static numbers
- **Gaming UX**: Mobile-first design with micro-interactions that feel like premium gaming apps

## Creative Standards

This application must achieve:
- **$10M startup quality** - Should rival Robinhood's trading UX + Clash Royale's engagement + TikTok's content discovery
- **Creative differentiation** - Neon-dark gaming aesthetic, animated charts, social features built into core flows
- **Production readiness** - Sub-2 second page loads, 60fps animations, mobile PWA quality
- **AI-executable specs** - Every task has binary completion criteria with real verification commands

## Rules

1. **One task at a time, then continue.** Do not work on multiple tasks at once.
2. **Run verify commands.** Every task has real, executable verification that must pass.
3. **Fix until green.** Do not move on until verification passes completely.
4. **No refactors unless specified.** Implement minimum changes to satisfy acceptance criteria.
5. **Check off completed tasks.** Mark `[x]` and add 1-2 line completion note.
6. **Follow the runbook.** All dev commands are in `docs/RUNBOOK.md`.
7. **Never commit secrets.** Use `.env.local` for credentials, check `.env.example`.
8. **Use recommended packages.** Follow `docs/DECISIONS.md` technology choices exactly.
9. **Read before writing.** Always read existing files before modifying them.
10. **Premium quality only.** Every component should feel polished and production-ready.
